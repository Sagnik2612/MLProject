#Logging is a means of tracking events that
# happen when some software runs. The softwareâ€™s developer adds 
# logging calls to their code to indicate that certain events have occurred. 
# An event is described by a descriptive message which can optionally contain variable data
# (i.e. data that is potentially different for each occurrence of the event).
# Events also have an importance which the developer ascribes to the event; 
# the importance can also be called the level or severity.

#The next step is to actually create the directories with file 
#operations and track the loggins

#os.path.split() method in Python is used
# to Split the path name into a pair, and tail. 
# Here, the tail is the last path name component
# and the head is everything leading up to that.
#eg-path='/home/user/Desktop/file.txt' 
#split into- head='/home/user/Desktop/' and
#tail='file.txt'
#The output of os.path.split(filepath) is a 
# filedirectory(filedir/head) and filename (tail)
#filedir,filename=os.path.split(filepath)

#The immediate goal is- if the filedir is NOT empty " "
#then make the directory for that specific file

#if the filepath does not exist or the path size 
# with (getsize(path) function)
#is 0 then we will open the file in write 'w' mode
#and simply pass because we are not appending anything
#When the pass statement is executed, nothing happens,
#but you avoid getting an error when empty code is not allowed
#The filepath in this case is already empty so 
# it will create an empty file

#Else the logging will show that the filename already exists
